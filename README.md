ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

Dr. Wenfang Xie deserves special thanks for supplying critical project information and assisting with the project's completion.

ABSTRACT: 
My project aims to create a Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) based Pick & Place robot. I am using DTMF because it has no range limit and no limited frequency range. It Provides an Advantage of Robust Control. The working range is dependent on the service provider hence robot can be controlled over large distances. And signals will not interfere with other controllers.
In this project, the pick & place robot is controlled by a mobile phone. One phone is attached to a robot which receives the call from another mobile phone. The corresponding tone is transmitted at the other end when a key is pressed on the dial-pad during the call. The robot will receive the corresponding tones with the help of a phone attached to the robot via Aux cable. Then the DTMF decoder sends a particular digital signal to the microcontroller and finally, the microcontroller will decide what motion to perform. Finally, the microcontroller is programmed to take any action based on the 4-bit data from the DTMF MT8870 decoder module. the motor driver drives the robot forward, reverse, left and right, and the mechanical arm (with 3 DOF) is controlled wirelessly over GSM.


INTRODUCTION: 
In the previous 15 years, robotics has experienced tremendous growth and development. Today, a large portion of research resources are used to develop this field, as it has several applications in both commercial and military settings [5]. Many recent innovations have been motivated by the desire to use them for the welfare of society and to minimize human effort or workload. 
A robot is an electromechanical system that may assist humans in operating in locations where physical presence is difficult or impossible due to the circumstances, such as a space or location that is on fire [2]. Furthermore, traditional remote-operated arms have limitations, such as a poor human interface, circuit flaws, an unfavourable atmosphere for remote operations, and limited functionality. However, by incorporating wireless advancements into the electromechanical arm, these limits might be reduced. Also, doing so would expand the arm's applicability, strength, and usage. DTMF was utilized to control the robot remotely through GSM in this project.
The Robot is created for space explorations or for regions where people are unable to reach. The user will direct the robot’s motions and will pick and place the required object Many studies in communication have recently been conducted and evolved for the benefit of society [5]. We are employing DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) communication technology to control the robot movement generated by cell phones in this project. The DTMF tone must be decoded. The DTMF decoder is utilized in conjunction with the microcontroller, and its output is coupled to the motor driving IC, which in turn is connected to the DC motors that drive the wheels and servo motors which are connected to the arm. The robot arm is the second most significant component as it assists in picking and placing objects.
DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) is a telecommunication signalling system that uses the voice-frequency band to communicate between telephone equipment, communications devices, and switching centres through telephone lines. In 1963, the Bell System in the United States created DTMF, which was later trademarked as Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones that was sold to customers. DTMF is standardized as ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. in the UK it is known as MF4. Further, DTMF tones were also utilized by high-quality TV telecasters to show the beginning and ending timings of station breaks in the early 1980s [5].
Dual-tone multi-frequency has been the foundation of the tone of voice articulation management. Up to date, telephonic connections use DTMF to dial volumes, configure telephonic trades coming from different control destinations and so on [5].

I2C Communication protocol: 
In this project Motor Driver: 4WD TB6612 Motor Driver Shield Board(slave) uses I2C protocol us communicate with the master(microcontroller). The slave address of the motor driver is 0x47 so the address frame will have 0x47 after that, the data frame will carry an 8-bit instruction that is to be performed on the motors.  
I have used “Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h” to drive servo motors and the DC motors. 
Let’s take a simple example of one instruction and see how it is executed. Using I2C protocol.

setPWM(channel, on, off) 
On a given channel, this function sets the start (on) and end (off) of the high segment of the PWM pulse on a specific channel. signal turns on and off, and you provide the 'tick' number, which ranges from 0...4095. Channel indicates which of the 16 PWM outputs should be updated with the new values. 
•	channel: The channel that should be updated with the new values (0...15)
•	on: The tick (between 0...4095) when the signal should transition from low to high
•	off: the tick (between 0...4095) when the signal should transition from high to low
whenever setPWM() is called the SDA pin will carry that message as follows,

Pulse width Modulation: 
PWM is a technique for decreasing the average power produced by an electrical signal by breaking it down into discrete components. The average value of the voltage supplied to the load is controlled by turning the switch on and off at a very fast speed. If the switch is on for a longer period when compared to off, then the average power delivered is larger.

In this project the Speed is controlled by “pwm.setPWM(odd-numbered channel, 0, speeds)” here in the code “speeds” is set to 1000. Where 4095 is 100% of the speed, therefore, all the DC motors in this project are rotating at (1000/4095) *100 = 24.63% of maximum speed. 

Applications 
1.	Cheaper than Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules.
2.	We can set up a Security Layer: when we connect through a phone call in the first instance, we must input a password to control the robot.
3.	Unlimited range.
4.	Reduces code and circuit complexity.

Conclusion: 
This article details the DTMF project, which combines concepts of robotics and Communication i.e., Dual-tone multi-frequency. The robot will move according to the instructions given, pick, and place the objects with the help of the Arm. This project can be utilized for study, and with future improvement, it might be used for research in regions where people can't survive and are out of reach. This project can further be improved by using a GSM shield instead of using a cell phone for receiving DTMF tones.
